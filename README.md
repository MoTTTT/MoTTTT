#  Martin Colley, as at December 2023

I'm Martin Colley, an Electronics Engineer, and IT Specialist. I am currently taking an employment gap after working for 34 years in the Telecommunications Information Technology industry.

I'm married to Norma Colley, and have a daughter, Thandi, and a son, Adam. I am immensely proud of my family.

Norma, to whom I have been married for 30 years this year, is an Industrial Psychologist, and my soul-mate.
Thandi is an Electronics Engineer, and works in London, specialising in Radar.
Adam has graduated as an Electronics Engineer, and will be doing his Masters after taking a break.

## Interests

- Electronics, which interest started before studying engineering, as a high school hobyist.
- Open Source products, which I have used in a personal capacity since 1995, and in industry for many years.
- DevSecOps, where in my capacity as an IT Specialist, I have driven a program to implement on-premise Open Source DevSecOps tooling.  
- Publishing content written by my family. My parents both wrote, as does my wife. I also dabble.
- Software, which I encountered in my youth and have been writing ever since.
- Languages, which I see as related to my interest in software. I am currently learning Spanish using Duolingo.
- Playing music, which I believe is related to my interest in all of the above. I play the guitar, the drums, and sing.
- Philisophy and Comparative Religion, which interest I inherited from my Father.
